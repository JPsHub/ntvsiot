##Summary
The NTVS (Node.js Tools for Visual Studio) UWP Extension enables developers to deploy Node.js as a [Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application](https://github.com/ms-iot/node-uwp-wrapper) 
to Windows 10 IoT Core devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi), Windows 10 Desktop, and Windows 10 Mobile. 
This extension is written as a [project subtype](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb166488.aspx) of [NTVS](http://aka.ms/ntvs) and extends some if its functionality like IntelliSense and debugging.

##Try it out!
Follow the instructions [here](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/samples/NodejsWU.htm) for the steps to install the required software and to build your first 'Hello World' Node.js server.
You can also try out the [Blinky sample](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/samples/NodejsWUBlinky.htm) which shows the use of WinRT APIs inside a Node.js server to toggle an LED on or off.
